This two step guide explains how to install **FFmpeg** and **ImageMagick** on macOS using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

### Let's get started!

<Steps>

  <Step title="Step 1: Install Homebrew (if not already installed)">

    First, check if Homebrew is installed by running the following command in your terminal:
    ```bash
    brew --version
    ```
    Check out this video tutorial if you're not familiar with terminal.

        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
        allowfullscreen
      ></iframe>

   

    If Homebrew is not installed, you can install it using the following command:
    ```bash
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
    ```

    After installation, if you're prompted to add Homebrew to your system `PATH`, **copy the provided command** and run it with `sudo`. You may see something like this:
    
    ![Path Setup](../images/path.png)

    like this but [you should copy it from the your terminal output of the previous command]
    ```
    sudo echo /Users/<your mac username>/.zprofile
    echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> /Users/<your mac username>/.zprofile eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
    ```

    It will ask for your login password and you're done with the brew installation.

    For more detailed instructions, visit the [Homebrew Installation Guide](https://brew.sh).
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Step 2: Install FFmpeg and ImageMagick">
    Once Homebrew is installed and correctly added to your system's `PATH`, you can install **FFmpeg** and **ImageMagick** with the following command:
    ```bash
    brew install ffmpeg imagemagick
    ```

    FFmpeg is a powerful tool for working with video and audio, and ImageMagick is used for image processing. This command will install both utilities at once.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Step 3: Verify Installation">
    After the installation completes, verify that both tools are installed by checking their versions:
    ```bash
    ffmpeg -version
    magick -version
    ```

    You should see version information for FFmpeg and ImageMagick, confirming that they were installed successfully.
  </Step>
  
</Steps>

## You're All Set!

Now that both **FFmpeg** and **ImageMagick** are installed, youâ€™re ready to start using them in your projects!
