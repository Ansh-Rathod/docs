Pimosa relies on three essential libraries to deliver powerful media processing capabilities:

- **FFmpeg**
- **ImageMagick**
- **ExifTool**

These libraries are automatically installed during the initial startup of Pimosa, ensuring a smooth experience for non-technical users. However, if you prefer manual installation, check out our [installation guide](/installation/install-libraries-on-mac).

### How It Works

Pimosa runs the following command in the background to handle the library installations seamlessly:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ansh-Rathod/pimosa-builds/HEAD/install_libs_mac.sh)"
```

This command ensures that you donâ€™t have to deal with the complexities of manual installation.

## ðŸ”’ Your Security Matters

During the automated setup, Pimosa **may** (mostly it won't if homebrew is installed) prompt for your device password to grant administrative access needed for installing the libraries. **Rest assured:**

- **Your password is never stored, logged, or accessed by Pimosa.** installation script uses native macOS APIs to grant administrative access.
- The password stays within the secure environment of the installation script.
- installion script is forever open-source, so you can verify its security.

Your security and privacy are our top priorities.

## Automated Setup

Pimosa automates the installation of these libraries during the first launch using an open-source script. This process ensures:

- **Hassle-free setup**: No terminal commands needed.
- **Optimized for macOS**: Works seamlessly on macOS.
- **Automatic updates**: Libraries are kept up-to-date in the background.

## Why These Libraries Are Needed

### FFmpeg

FFmpeg is the backbone of Pimosa's video and audio processing features. It enables:

- Video compression, trimming, and conversion.
- Audio extraction and manipulation.
- GIF creation and much more.

### ImageMagick

ImageMagick handles image processing tasks, allowing Pimosa to:

- Resize, crop, flip, and rotate images.
- Apply filters and effects.
- Convert between different image formats.

### ExifTool

ExifTool is used to read, write, and edit metadata in image, audio, and video files. Pimosa uses ExifTool to:

- Extract metadata like creation date, camera model, GPS info, etc.
- Modify metadata for batch processing.

Pimosa is designed to handle these installations automatically. Manual setup is only recommended if you encounter issues with the automated process on macOS.
