### Installing Required Dependencies for Pimosa

Pimosa requires two powerful libraries - FFmpeg and ImageMagick - to handle media processing and image manipulation tasks. This guide will walk you through installing these essential dependencies on your Mac.

### Why Does Pimosa Need These Libraries?

Pimosa relies on these libraries for several core features:

- FFmpeg: A multimedia framework that powers Pimosa's video processing capabilities
- ImageMagick: A robust tool that handles Pimosa's image manipulation tasks

### Quick Installation

We've created a simple installation script that handles everything automatically. Just follow these two steps:

## Step 1: Run the Installation Script

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ansh-Rathod/pimosa-builds/HEAD/install_libs_mac.sh)"
```

Our script will:

1. Check for existing installations
2. Install Homebrew (Mac's package manager) if needed
3. Install FFmpeg and ImageMagick
4. Verify the installations
5. Show you where everything is installed

## What to Expect

The installation process is automated and will:

- Detect your Mac's system architecture
- Install only what's missing (no duplicate installations)
- Set up proper system paths
- Validate all installations
- Provide clear feedback during the process

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Make sure you have a stable internet connection
2. Ensure you have at least 1GB of free disk space
3. Check that you entered your administrator password when prompted
4. If Pimosa still can't find the libraries, verify the installation paths shown in the script output

## Verification

After installation, you can verify that Pimosa can access these libraries by:

1. Opening Pimosa
2. Click on Setup button
3. Checking the paths output by the installation script

## Next Steps

Once installed, you can start using all of Pimosa's media processing features. Check out our other documentation pages to learn more about what you can do with Pimosa.
